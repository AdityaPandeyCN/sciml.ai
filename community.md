# SciML Scientific Machine Learning Community

## Community Standards

Everyone in the community must adhere to the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

## Official Channels

The following are the official channels of communication for the SciML community.

### Github

Development discussions should occur on Github through issues and pull requests.
See the [SciML Github Organization](https://github.com/SciML) for a full
list of repositories.

### Discourse

Our open webform is provided courteously of the
[Julia programming language disourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)
using the tags `diffeq` or `sciml`, and using the domain
[Modeling & Simulations](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/models/21).
When using this discourse, you must adhere to
[the Julia community rules](https://julialang.org/community/).

### StackOverflow

Questions on StackOverflow can be asked with the
[differentialequations.jl](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/differentialequations.jl)
tag.

### Twitter

For updates on recent scientific machine learning developers, follow
[@SciML_Org](https://twitter.com/SciML_Org)

### Chat

For casual conversation and informal questions, we provide an open
chatroom. The chatroom is openly available through the
[Gitter JuliaDiffEq/lobby](https://gitter.im/JuliaDiffEq/Lobby). This
channel is also bridged to the Julialang Slack and is accessible in
the #diffeq-bridged and #sciml channels. For access to the Slack, please ask for
an invite via [this link](https://slackinvite.julialang.org/).
