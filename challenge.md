# SciML Scientific Machine Learning Challenge Problems and Datasets

As a service to the scientific machine learning research community,
the SciML organization routinely runs and hosts challenge problems
with research datasets in order to facilitate the advancement of
scientific machine learning as a discipline. These problems come with
open datasets, description of the classical numerical techniques used
on the problem, and with starter code utilizing SciML software to
help methodological research jump directly to the cutting edge of the
field on a practical problem.

## The Helicopter SciML Challenge Problem

[The Helicopter SciML challenge problem](https://github.com/SciML/HelicopterSciML.jl)
was contributed by the University
of South-Eastern Norway. The dataset is derived from a laboratory
helicopter from which measurements of the pitch and yaw angles are
coupled with measurements of the electrical inputs into the rotaries.
Simple first principles derivations for the helicopter physics are given
and are demonstrated to not explain the full dynamics of the system.
The goal is to learn the missing physics required to give a description
of the accurately predicting system.

## The Magnetic Navigation (MagNav) Challenge Problem

More details to be announced soon.
