# Code of Conduct

The SciML community strongly values inclusivity and diversity. Everyone
should treat others with the utmost respect. Everyone in the community
must adhere to the
[NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) which
reflects the values of our community. Violations of the code should be
reported to members of the steering council, where the offenses will be
handled on a case-by-case basis.

## THE SHORT VERSION

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
