This release is the long-awaited DAE extravaganza! We are releasing fully-implicit
DAE integrators written in pure Julia, and thus compatible with items things like
GPUs and arbitrary precision. We have various DAE initialization schemes to
allow for automatically finding consistent initial conditions, and have also
upgraded our solvers to solve state and time dependent mass matrices. These
results have also trickled over to DiffEqFlux, with the new neural ODE structs
which support singular mass matrices (DAEs). Together this is a very comprehensive
push into the DAE world.

## DImplicitEuler and DBDF2: Fully Implicit DAE Solvers in Pure Julia

## DAE Initialization Choices

## State and time dependent mass matrices, i.e. M(u,p,t)u'=f(u,p,t)

## Neural DAE Structs in DiffEqFlux

## Massive Neural ODE Performance Improvements

## Second Order Sensitivity Analysis

## Magnus Integrators for u'=A(t)u

# Next Directions

Here's some things to look forward to:

- Automated matrix-free finite difference PDE operators
- Jacobian reuse efficiency in Rosenbrock-W methods
- High Strong Order Methods for Non-Commutative Noise SDEs
- Stochastic delay differential equations
