# SciML at JuliaCon 2021

[JuliaCon 2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/) was an exciting conference filled
with talks about new Julia software and use cases. Specifically this year saw
an exponential rise in the number of talks featuring the SciML Open Source
Software Organization. To help those interested, this post will highlight some
of the talks which showcase the SciML tools.

## Adaptive and extendable numerical simulations with Trixi.jl

Trixi.jl is a hyperbolic PDE solving package which uses
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) for its time stepping.
It adds features for meshing and defining stable spatial discretizations.

compatible with the DifferentialEquations.jl time stepping methods, and thus
is a nice addition to the ecosystem providing spectral element discretizations
of common PDEs.
