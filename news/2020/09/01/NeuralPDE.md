# SciML Ecosystem Update:

Augmented neural differential equations
https://github.com/SciML/Quadrature.jl
ReactionNetworkImporters and CellML on Catalyst

# Next Directions

The next directions are going to be highly tied to the directions that
we are going with the latest Google Summer of Code, so here are a few
things to look forward to:

- Higher efficiency low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with a demonstration
  of optimality in a large-scale climate model (!!!).
- Continued improvements to parallel and sparse automatic differentiation.
- More performance
